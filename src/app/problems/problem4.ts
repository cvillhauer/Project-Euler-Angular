I have no idea if there is a 'mathy' way to determine a number is a palindrome, but converting a number to a string and checking for palindrome seems like an obvious option.
Shockingly, I got the right answer on my first try with a brute force attempt, even though I'm great at making off-by-one index errors.
A performance of ~200 miliseconds isn't bad, but I'm sure we can do better.
I wonder if it is faster to count down from n-1 rather than going from 1-n... This only works if we can break once we have the largest palindrome though.
A lot of different methods I tried that were faster would get a lower (wrong) palindrome answer.
A bit of internet research yielded the theoem that a palindrome number is divisible by 11, which means either i or j need to be divisible by 11.
This made me decide to short-circuit my loops so that the outer loop steps down by 11 each time, which sped things up a lot. Down to 20 miliseconds...
I squeezed out a tiny bit more speed by breaking out of the inner loop once the first palindrome for that i value is found. Lowering j will only get us smaller palindromes.
To maximize flexibility of my code, I'm not bothering to set the lower limits of i and j to 100 (smallest 3-digit number), I'm just leaving them at 1.
